The error of the state not being updated was due to the states being sent not being structured properly. 
This means that the way the state was organized or formatted was incorrect, which caused the state updates to fail. To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the state is structured correctly before sending it. This involves checking the format, data types, and overall organization of the state to make sure it aligns with the expected structure in your application.
